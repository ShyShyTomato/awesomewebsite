it appears that it's time for me to give my thoughts about former green mp golriz gharaman's little legal saga ending

to be honest, i think that her getting fined $1,600 is probably a suitable punishment. she clearly wasn't being herself and was quite unwell at the time of the shoplifting. she had repeatedly recieved a ton of threats from internet incel weirdos and the like. people saying that she played the "mental health card" are kinda silly ngl because she was using it as an explanation and not a complete shield from wrongdoing. that's my take :3

this was mostly a test post, and also btw this isn't a politics blog~ that'd be boring as shit, i just wanna write about anything that's on my mind and that probably is gonna include that ig - also btw i literally just checked the news to find the first thing i could yap about. i guess deployment has been successfully tested. full epic engaging real awesome cute posts are coming soon.

meow :3 bai bai!!
